Module-Which version 0.02
=========================

'Module::Which' is the basis of the script 'which_pm' intented
to show which version of a Perl module is installed (if it is there at all).

Modules are searched by name (like 'YAML') or by subcategories
('DBD::' means all modules under the DBD subdirectories of
your Perl installation, matching both 'DBD::Oracle' and 'DBD::ODBC::Changes').

This module is very simple and most won't need it.
But it has been instructive for the author to see how many broken modules
one can find under your Perl installation (some which don't accept
even a 'require' statement), modules with no version number and
documentation files (named '.pm') which do not return a true value.

To find out modules under subcategories, L<Module::Find> by Christian
Renz was used.

Well, all that said, this module is no more than automating:

  perl -MInteresting::Module -e 'print $Interesting::Module'

or better the one-liner

  perl -e '$pm = shift; eval "require $pm"; print ${"${pm}::VERSION"}' DBI

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  GetOpt::Long
  Pod::Usage
  Test::More
  File::Spec::Unix
  File::Glob
  File::Find

and recommends

  Test::Pod

TO DO

* needs a more comprehensive test suite.

* implement more options on which() behavior

  return => 'ARRAY' | 'HASH' | 'HASH(FIRST)' | 'HASH(MULT)' | 'HASH(LIST)'
  verbose => 0 | 1

  include => @INC
  method => 'REQUIRE' | 'EXTRACT'
  info   => @fields


* finish documentation of Data::Hash::Transform
* stuff Data::Hash::Transform into its own distribution

* fix bug in --help option
* introduce more options to control C<which_pm> behavior: C<--include>, 
  C<--method>, etc.

* always update "META.yml" before releasing (this is not
  being done automatically because MakeMaker overwrite
  keys like 'license' and 'recommends')

* which_pm should produce nice output for narrow terminal window sizes.
* which_pm should be able to report the version of perl (and other Perl scripts)
* a more complete implementation of --version for which_pm 
  (copyright and license included)

* support the pattern '' as a shortcut to show all installed modules
  in include directories
* finish documentation of Module::Which::List
