Module-Which version 0.01_03
============================

'Module::Which' is the basis of the script 'which_pm' intented
to show which version of a Perl module is installed (if it is there at all).

Modules are searched by name (like 'YAML') or by subcategories
('DBD::*' means all modules under the DBD subdirectories of
your Perl installation, matching both 'DBD::Oracle' and 'DBD::ODBC::Changes').

This module is very simple and most won't need it.
But it has been instructive for the author to see how many broken modules
one can find under your Perl installation (some which don't accept
even a 'require' statement), modules with no version number and
documentation files (named '.pm') which do not return a true value.

To find out modules under subcategories, L<Module::Find> by Christian
Renz was used.

Well, all that said, this module is no more than automating:

  perl -MModule::I::Want::To::Know::About -e "print $Module::I::Want::To::Know::About::VERSION"

or better the one-liner

  perl -e '$pm = shift; eval "require $pm"; print ${"${pm}::VERSION"}' DBI

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Module::Find

TO DO

* which_pm should produce a nicer output for long module names.

* needs a more comprehensive test suite.

* implement more options on which() behavior

  return => 'ARRAY' | 'HASH' | 'HASH(FIRST)' | 'HASH(MULT)' | 'HASH(LIST)'
  verbose => 0 | 1

  include => @INC
  method => 'REQUIRE' | 'EXTRACT'
  info   => @fields

* include the file path in the information about a Perl module

* finish documentation of Data::Hash::Transform
* stuff Data::Hash::Transform into its own distribution

* fix bug in --help option
* introduce more options to control C<which_pm> behavior: C<--include>, 
  C<--method>, etc.
