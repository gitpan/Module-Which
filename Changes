Revision history for Perl extension Module::Which.

0.0204 Sun May 21 2006
        - Term::Size is recommended
        - when determining terminal size, non-tty STDOUT
          prevents truncation
        - if possible, terminal width is retrieved with
          the help of Term::Size

0.02_03 Thu Dec  27 2005
        - new switch -I for specifying the library paths
        - correspoding changes to Module::Which
        - new switch -w for specifying terminal width

0.02_02 Thu Dec  8 2005
        - module versions are obtained via MM->parse_file
          after using EE::MM

0.02_01 Fri Oct 28 2005
        - now which_pm uses String::Truncate when file paths
          are too long (instead of simple truncate)
        - documented bug about wrong versions when multiple
          instances are found in library path

0.02    Mon Oct 10 2005
        - just the same as 0.01_05
        - it's a shame: the only purpose of this
          release it to raise my kwalitee to 16.0
          as development versions aren't counted

0.01_05 Tue Jun 24-? 2005
        - added a "--p5p" option to which_pm so that Config-related
          paths can be shown
        - wrote tests for the previously introduced modules
        - wrote Module::Which::P5Path to make Config-related
          translations: like "/usr/lib/perl5/Module/Which.pm" to
          '${sitelib}/Module/Which.pm'

0.01_04 Tue Jun 21 2005
        - file path was include in the information about
          a Perl module 'which_pm' gives
        - replaced "t/Module-Which.t" with "t/001basic.t"
          which uses the mock modules under "t/tlib" to test
        - the bug of not being able to find multiple installed
          versions of a module with an exact pattern like 'YAML'
          is gone with the use of Module::Which::List
        - subcategories are now written DBD:: instead of DBD::*
        - replaced Module::Find dependency by a new module
          Module::Which::List which allows me to recover
          the module path
        - option --version reports a sensible program name with
          "basename($0)"
        - added --version option to which_pm with corresponding docs 

0.01_03 Tue Jun 21 2005
        - improved a bit the output of 'which_pm' by finding
          out the maximum length of a module name before printing
        - temporarily, "META.yml" will not be automatically
          updated by MakeMaker (so that the correct license is set)
        - "bin/which_pm.PL" renamed to "bin/which_pm"
        - added "t/003pod.t" to test POD for errors 
          (when Test::Pod 1.00 is there)
        - completed documentation of Data::Hash::Transform
          which was truncated and buggy

0.01_02 Tue Jun 16 2005
        - options '--verbose' and '--quiet' supported by now
        - use of Getopt::Long and Pod::Usage in which_pm.pl
        - bug in Module::Which documented
        - test script for Data::Hash::Transform: "t/002hash.t"
        - code for converting from an array of hashes to hash of hashes
          moved to Data::Hash::Transform

0.01_01 Tue Jun 15 2005
        - experimental code to downgrade the source
          code to 5.005
        - which_pm is not verbose by default anymore:
          set environment variable WHICH_PM_VERBOSE 
        - options to customize which() behavior:
          'return' and 'verbose'
        - which() now returns an array ref by default
          and optionally a hash ref
        - added reference to existing CPAN modules 

0.01  Tue Jun 14 2005
        - first release to CPAN

0.01  Tue Jun 14 14:58:05 2005
        - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
                -AX -n Module::Which
